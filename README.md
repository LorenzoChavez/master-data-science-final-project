# Final project of the master in Data Science

This project has been developed by [Antonio Ramos](https://github.com/antonioramos1/) and [Lorenzo Chavez](https://github.com/LorenzoChavez).

It  consits of three parts:
-   Deep Learning: embeddings extraction
-   Recomendation system: cosine  similarity
-   Web app: Flask app powered by Keras

The Fashion industry is changing. Online stores have more and more clothing items and itÂ´s becoming confusing due to the number of options to filter having increased noticeably and finding the clothes you really want is not so easy anymore

This project will try to offer a solution to these problems by allowing customers to have recommendations of products they may be interested to purchase based on an image they have previously provided.

On the images below you can see a summary of the project flow.
